                    <p class="why-p">Humans have used plants for their medicinal qualities for thousands of years
                        to cure all manner of aches, pains, and maladies. Before pharmaceuticals, 
                        plants were all we had. Even today, pharmaceuticals use plants and/or their active compounds to bring relief to people everywhere.<br>
                        Medicinal plants have many uses. They can be used in teas, creams, tinctures, baths, 
                        and ground into a powder to be made into pills. Each method has its own pros and cons and uses.</p>
